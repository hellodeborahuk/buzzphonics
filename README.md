## 👨‍💻 Demo

Check out the website: [Phonics Sounds](https://focused-swirles-0bc3a1.netlify.app/)

## About this project

I want to create a phonics sound page that I can save on my phone and have to hand when reading with my daughter who's just started learning to read. I often need to find out what a certain sound is and end up googling it every time. I need something quick and easy to click on. 

Simple idea - a list of sounds to listen to ✔️

Small stretch goal - flip whole page and it has images (e.g fox for f) instead of the letter ✔️

Stretch goal - login and track progress through the sounds

## Design

Inspired by [Nature Sounds App by Lay](https://dribbble.com/shots/8832668-Nature-Sounds-App) on Dribbble I created [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/rGauNq8bzvkADENejijRWX/Phonics-design?node-id=0%3A1) in Figma.

I want it to be bright and fun for me to be able to use with my kids.


## Starting out

I've created a React app with React Router v6 to manage different pages. I was going to keep this a simple JavaScript website but if I go for my stretch goals I think this will be easier with React. I've created the 3 pages so far, and created the divs for all the sounds. I used map() to loop through the array of sounds and also assigned each a random background colour from the ones chosen in the design. Stumbling block so far, how to make the buttons square?
