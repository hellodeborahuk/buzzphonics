## 🗣️ About this project

I want to create a phonics sound page that I can save on my phone and have to hand when reading with my daughter who's just started learning to read. I often need to find out what a certain sound is and end up googling it every time. I need something quick and easy to click on. 

- Simple idea - a list of sounds to listen to ✔️

- Small stretch goal - flip whole page and it has images (e.g fox for f) instead of the letter ✔️

- Stretch goal - login and track progress through the sounds
- Stretch goal 2 - games ✔️
